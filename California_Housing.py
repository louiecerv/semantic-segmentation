    Size: Contains 20,640 data points, each representing a census block group.
    Features:
    8 independent variables:
    MedInc: Median income in the block group.
    HouseAge: Median age of houses in the block group.
    AveRooms: Average number of rooms per household.

    Population: Population of the block group.
    AveOccup: Average number of household members.
    Latitude: Geographical latitude of the block group centroid.

    \nFunction: Learns a non-linear mapping between input data and continuous target values.
    Architecture: Includes an input layer, one or more hidden layers with non-linear 
    activation functions, and an output layer.
    \nTraining: Optimizes the squared error using learning algorithms like LBFGS

    Uses: Suitable for complex regression problems where linear models might not
